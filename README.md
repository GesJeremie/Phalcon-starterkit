Phalcon-starterkit
==================

Phalcon is a wonderful C-based framework. It works fast and is really flexible, but its flexibility become a default as there is no fixed default structure when you start your project.

The Phalcon StarterKit was developed to let people start their project with a ready-to-use structure which doesn't need further configuration.
